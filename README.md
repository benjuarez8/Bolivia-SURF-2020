# Bolivia-SURF-2020
This project was funded by the Caltech SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship) program.  These materials were used to conduct an analysis of the 2019 Bolivian presidential election such that each mesa (voting booth) was classified as either clean or at-risk using the Random Forest algorithm.  The code for the preliminary data analysis, data processing, construction of necessary datasets, machine learning implementation, performance analysis, and visualization outputs are included.  This project was mentored by Professor R. Michael Alvarez.
